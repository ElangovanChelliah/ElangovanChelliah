With a strong background in R&D and Production, I bring a logical and analytical approach to electronic product development. My expertise spans across various areas including product research, planning, design, programming, testing, troubleshooting, and documentation.

I thrive in collaborative environments and excel in handling multiple projects simultaneously. My skill set includes proficiency in embedded hardware and software development, DFMA, cost analysis, enclosure design, IoT sensor networks, data analytics, and more.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in active hobbies like strumming chords, swimming, and cycling. I'm also an avid reader, with a particular fascination for aviation.
